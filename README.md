ABOUT:
This web application allows users to complete a customer feedback survey and automatically sends the survey responses to a specified email address. Built with React and SurveyJS for the frontend and Node.js with Express and Nodemailer for the backend, the application collects user input, processes the data, and emails the results securely. The server is configured to use Gmail's SMTP with app passwords for authentication, ensuring reliable email delivery.

How to Fix the Gmail Authentication Error (EAUTH 535)
1. Use an App Password Instead of Your Gmail Password
Gmail no longer allows direct login with your normal password when using third-party applications like Nodemailer. Instead, you must generate an App Password.

ðŸ”¹ Steps to Generate an App Password:

Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account:

Go to ðŸ”— Google Security Settings.
Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification" and enable it.
Generate an App Password:

Go to ðŸ”— Google App Passwords.
Under "Select App", choose "Mail".
Under "Select Device", choose "Other (Custom Name)" and enter "Nodemailer".
Click "Generate" and copy the 16-character password (e.g., abcd efgh ijkl mnop).

Use SMTP Settings Instead of service: "gmail"
If the issue persists, use SMTP settings directly:

<!-- let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 465, // Use 587 if TLS is needed
  secure: true, // true for 465, false for 587
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL,
    pass: process.env.PASSWORD,
  },
}); -->
